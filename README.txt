Scripts and data for the dimension reduction project

main scripts and utility functions:
- one_dimension_spectral_reduction.R : script with various functions to conduct the dimension reduction of a given spatial landscape.
- Dynamics : folder with scripts related to the dynamics (dispersal functions, growth functions and metapop dynamics).
- Networks : utility functions for network generation and manipulations.
    
Folders named "Fig_xxx" are each responsible for running a set of simulations and plot the associated figure(s).
In each folder, run locally Generate_networks.R, then Simulations.R, then plot_figures.R to reconduct the full analysis.


Plot_networks is a folder to plot some example networks for illustration purposes.
